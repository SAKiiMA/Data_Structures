# Data_Structures

These lines of code have been written as part of course **CS50_fall 2018** reference to **[Problem set 4](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/4/index.html)**

Codes have been partially provided by `Harvard` and purpose was to implement lines of code focusing on using **`pointers`**. Both _hash_speller_ & _trie_speller_ do the same task. The difference is that former is implementing a **`hash_table`** data structure to load the dictionary while latter uses a **`trie`** data structure.

However, their functionality is that they load a dictionary and check a text_file for misspellings. try:

`$ make speller`  
`$ ./speller lalaland.txt`
